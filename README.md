# hello-world1
This is my second (stuffed the first one up) git repository. Learning to git it so that I can get it. Don't ask how I stuffed it up (missed a tick in the tutorial), but do ask me about myself.

I like to write stuff (like HTML, CSS, php, VB etc., as well as English stuff) and teach that stuff to those things in schools called students.
